# Compressing an image using KMeans clustering algorithm

- used `matplotlib` and `scikitlearn` libraries
- reduced the colors of the image to only 16 colors which can be represented only with 4 bits look-up table

## I have learned the math and the algorithm from the `Andrew Ng` course of `Unsupervised Machine Learning`

I followed this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Y91ddBqaQ)
